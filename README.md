# CompEnvironmentsKGR
A repository for all the code used in our prototyping and making of our computational environments project 


Voice Changers
https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer/blob/master/README_en.md - this is the voice changer we use in the final process which is more reliable but uses a lot of CPU (?) 
https://voice.ai/ - this is the software we used for tests, it's quite dodgy I think so I wouldn't reccomend downloading
Virtual Audio Cable
https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/ this is the virtual audio cable we used
